Life Expectancy Prediction Project

This project aims to predict life expectancy using machine learning techniques. It involves only data preprocessing for ML.

Getting Started

> Data Preprocessing

Steps include loading the data, handling duplicates, feature engineering (e.g., encoding categorical variables), and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conduct EDA to understand data distributions, relationships, and patterns.
